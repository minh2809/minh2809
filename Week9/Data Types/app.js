// II. Data Types:
// String, Numbers, Boolean, null, undefined

const name = "John"; // can use either single or double quote
const agee = 30;
const isCool = true;
const rating = 4.5;
const x = null;
const m = undefined;
let z; // same as const z = undefined;

/*
    each object has its properties
*/
const Minh = {
  isMale: true,
  learning: "AI",
  school: "FPT",
};

console.log(typeof name);
console.log(typeof agee);
console.log(typeof isCool);
console.log(typeof rating);
console.log(typeof x);
// console.log(typeof Minh);
console.log(typeof z);

// undefined vs null:
/*
    undefined means that a variable is declared but not assigned
    declare: give something a name
    assign: give something a value

    => human example, Elon Musk Networth

    null is an assignment value. 
    It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value
